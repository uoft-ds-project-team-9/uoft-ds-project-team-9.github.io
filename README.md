# SCS3250 Group 9 Final Project

## Project Title
Major Crime indicators in Toronto 

## Description 
To Analyze a dataset that contains major crime indication for each neighborhood in Toronto.

## Dataset
http://data.torontopolice.on.ca/datasets/mci-2014-to-2019/data

## Objectives
- Determine highest crime month, day, time
- Location of crimes, by type
- Predict crime type in area, month? Is it possible to predict location or type of crime?
- Change in crime over time?
- Analyze relations between crime rate and season or day of week
- determine the safest (lowest crime rate) division in Toronto

## Todos
- Check missing values
- Check data types
- Check for duplicative rows or rows with too much missing information
- Check for location outliers, crime type outliers, etc
- Check for binary features that are not in binary form
- Categorize crime type
- Check date column is consistent and can be worked with (would it be worth separating into 3 features: year, day 1-365, time)
- Remove unneccessary columns
- Descriptive data of key features, which can also be used for imputation
- Basic visualization, and inspection of distribution for particular variables
